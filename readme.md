<!-- The following are just sample -->
The purpose of this project is to showcase Bootstrap and Tailwind features that we can add in our website, this is the final
requirement for our course CCS0027L.
Our group were assigned to create a clothing company to create a website, I specifically chose OXGN Fashion.

tablet responsive.
<br>
The key components of this project is that the 3 products that can be seen in the landing page has their own product pages,
the navigation bar and background images are responsive as well as the product cards in the products area,

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
